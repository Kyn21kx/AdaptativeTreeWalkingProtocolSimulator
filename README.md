# Adaptive tree walk protocol simulation program
## How to run
### NOTE:
This java program contains multiple references to different java libraries, as well as a couple of data structures within a package folder called "tools", so it is important for the user not to delete or change any files or their locations, as it might prevent the program from running smoothly
### Compilation:
In order to compile this program, the JDK is required, as well as having the environment PATH variable properly set to the java bin, if you do not yet have this configured, you can refer to: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html.

Once the path is properly set, you can run the javac command on any terminal, along with the name of the java file (```javac ATWP.java```).
### Execution:
After running the compilation, you'll get a new file called ATWP.class, this is what we'll use for the execution of the program, and we can now just type in the terminal ```java ATWP```, and the program should run with no more complications.
### Input file
The program comes with a default input file that contains the following format:
